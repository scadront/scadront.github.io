          <h3><em>Vertigo</em></h3>
          <p>I keep filling my pockets with nothing but moths and when I reach deep on down, surprise, all I&#39;ve found is the
    dust of a dream, filled with nothing but steam, built on wavering streams flowing towards nothing but emptiness,
    busting my stomach, my soul, and all that I know is it&#39;s wrong and this path is so long that it&#39;s short &#39;cause I
    spend all my time thinking they&#39;ll be more down the line &#39;til it&#39;s gone and it&#39;s withered and my baby&#39;s have
    children and I look back and see all that&#39;s become of me is a shadow soon lost and what was the cost but my
    life and my youth and all of the truth I once held in my heart but I&#39;d never re-start and I&#39;d never give up on the
    people, the times, and the memories lined in my brain, in my skin, maybe I didn&#39;t win and I sinned and I sinned
    but I met you, and her, and we laughed, saw the world, our emotions they stirred and they cried and they
    yearned and they grew and they eased and sometimes I&#39;m so pleased with the way it all went and the days that
    I spent searching for something big to fill up my head and maybe I&#39;ll find it or maybe I&#39;ll wind up all withered and
    worn but I&#39;ll take all the scorn and Iâ€™ll trade it for peace, my life is a lease and once it&#39;s paid off and I&#39;ve
    weathered the losses I hope, crave, I ache, that serenity takes me and sets me down softly on clouds made of
    moss tightly woven with sunshine so blinding I&#39;m bursting and no longer thirsting but become luminous light so
    incandescent the sight of it rouses nostalgia but also the faith that this life is so great there&#39;s no reason to pine,
    just keep walking your line and you&#39;ll get to the end, have no fear, don&#39;t relent, take a breath, take a breath,
    take a breath...</p>

          <h3><em>walk with me</em></h3>
          <p>Walk with me, talk with me, fly with me, cry with me, win, lose, get confused, kick off those shoes, relax, but not
too much. I do not trust this faith in truth, these simple rules, Siddhartha&#39;s logic is just too loose and I&#39;ve been
packed down too damn hard by all this greed and lust this smog and dust it hurts my chest, shakes my sense,
and as I try to hop this fence I learn too quick it won&#39;t relent so turning fast I hit the road with broken brow and
severed soul and never knowing where to go, I slow. Please someone tell me the way I couldn&#39;t stay, I left
before the sun came up that day, my heart is drained my shoes are frayed and I need a hand if I&#39;m to stand so
come with me, walk with me, talk with me, fly with me, cry with me, read it all out of me and suck it all in, now
release out, in, out, in, out, in, out...</p>
